        <h2>Pre-rendering</h2>
        <p>
          By default, <strong>Next.js pre-renders every page</strong>. This
          means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of
          having it all done by client-side JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.</p>
        <p>
          Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code
          necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its
          JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. This
          process is called <strong>hydration</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering:{" "}
          <strong>Static Generation</strong> and
          <strong> Server-side Rendering.</strong> The difference is in{" "}
          <strong>when</strong> it generates the HTML for a page.

        <h2>Why static?</h2>
        <p>
          We recommend using Static Generation over Server-side Rendering for
          performance reasons. Statically generated pages can be cached by CDN
          with no extra configuration to boost performance. However, in some
          cases, Server-side Rendering might be the only option.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use <strong>Client-side Rendering</strong> along with
          <strong> Static Generation</strong>.
